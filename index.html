<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>We can solve a 2D linear program in linear time. The key is that we need
to throw away a constant fraction of data away at each step. We'll represent our constraints by a set of halfplanes
and our objective function by a vector. The solution is the point in the intersection of halfplanes farthest in
the direction of the objective vector.</p>
<h3>The algorithm</h3>
<p>We start by first partitioning the halfplane boundaries into an <font color="#880000">upper envelope</font>
and a <font color="#008800">lower envelope</font>.
The <font color="#880000">upper envelope</font> pushes the feasible region in the same direction as the objective vector.
The <font color="#008800">lower envelope</font> pushes the feasible region against the objective vector.
If there is no <font color="#008800">lower envelope</font>, then the feasible region is unbounded, and the solution is at infinity.</p>
<img src="partition.gif" border="0"/>
<p>Now we pair up <font color="#880000">lower</font> boundaries with <font color="#880000">lower</font>
boundaries and <font color="#008800">upper</font> boundaries with <font color="#008800">upper</font> boundaries,
and find the median pair in the direction perpendicular to the objective vector.
Through the intersection of this pair, we'll draw a line parallel to the objective vector.
This <font color="#4682B4">median divider</font> separates the data into two sets of pairs.
We'll eventually discard half the data in one of the two sets.
This parts thus allows us to throw away a constant fraction of data at every step.</p>
<p>From the upper envelope, find the upper boundary that intersects the <font color="#4682B4">median divider</font> furthest <i>in the direction
of the objective</i>. From the lower envelope, find the lower boundary that intersects the <font color="#4682B4">median divider</font> furthest
<i>in the direction away from the objective</i>. We consider how these two lines intersect the <font color="#4682B4">median divider</font> by cases.</p>
<ol>
<li> <b>The <font color="#008800">lower boundary</font> intersects below the <font color="#880000">upper boundary</font></b>
This means that we're already in the feasible region. The solution is on the side of
the <font color="#4682B4">median divider</font> where the <font color="#008800">lower boundary</font>
gets farther away from the objective function.

<li> <b>The <font color="#008800">lower boundary</font> intersects above the <font color="#880000">upper boundary</font> and they're parallel</b>
This means that we're not in the feasible region. Since the two envelopes are convex, and our boundaries are parallel, there's no
hope of them intersecting, so there is no solution here.

<li> <b>The <font color="#008800">lower boundary</font> intersects above the <font color="#880000">upper boundary</font> and they're not parallel</b>
This means that we're not in the feasible region. There may yet be a feasible region but it's on the side of the
<font color="#4682B4">median divider</font> where the <font color="#880000">upper boundary</font> and <font color="#008800">lower boundary</font>
are getting closer together.

</ol>
<p>Now it's time to throw away some data. We'll keep everything on the side of the <font color="#4682B4">median divider</font> 
where the solution might be. On the other side, look at all the pairs of lines that we made earlier. For <font color="#880000">upper</font>
pairs, throw away the line that's farther from the direction of the objective as we move toward the <font color="#4682B4">median divider</font>.
For <font color="#008800">lower</font>
pairs, throw away the line that's farther in the direction of the objective as we move toward the <font color="#4682B4">median divider</font>.</p>

<p>Now we're ready to start the next step of the algorithm</p>
<h3>Base cases</h3>
<p>We consider two base cases here.</p>
<ol>
<li> <b>The <font color="#4682B4">median divider</font> intersects the uppermost cusp on the <font color="#008800">lower envelope</font></b>.
By cusp, we mean at the two boundary lines with opposite signed slopes intersect. In this case, if a solution exists, it exists at this
point. We simply check the feasibility of this point.
<p><img src="base1.gif" border="0"/></p>
<li> <b>The <font color="#008800">lower envelope</font> has only 1 line.</b>
The solution, if it exists, is on this boundary, intersecting one of the <font color="#880000">upper boundaries</font>. Steeper
<font color="#880000">upper boundaries</font> push the solution away from the direction
of the objective, while shallower <font color="#880000">upper boundaries</font>
push the solution in the direction of the objective. We find the intersection of the <font color="#008800">lower boundary</font> 
with steeper <font color="#880000">upper boundary</font> that is farthest away from the direction objective function.
As long as this point is in the feasible region, it is the solution. Otherwise, there is no solution.

</ol>
<h3>Runtime analysis</h3> 
<p>At the beginning of the algorithm, we partition the halfplane boundaries in linear time.</p>
<p>For each step of the algorithm, we do the following work:</p>
<ul>
<li> Pair up all lines in linear time
<li> Find the median in linear time
<li> Discard a quarter of the points in linear time
</ul>
<p>The recurrence relation is thus:</p>

<p>The Master Theorem tells us that the solution to the recurrence relation is:</p>

<p>Since the setting up and running the algorithm can both be accomplished in linear time, the overall algorithm is linear!</p>
